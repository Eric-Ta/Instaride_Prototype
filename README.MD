# InstaRide: a public transporation ticket system 
For this project, I (alongside a group of 4 others) developed a series of front-end prototypes to redesign a public transporation ticket purchasing system. <br />
The hi-fidelity prototype is created using C# and WPF <br />
Inside this repository, there is a pdf file called "Final Screenshots PDF.pdf" which contains our hi-fidelity prototyping of the system. <br />
I have also included files CPSC 481 InstaRide Part 1 and Part 2 ORIGINAL SUBMISSIONS.pdf and Final Redesign Changes to Implement.pdf which shows
the low-fidelity and medium-fidelity prototypes and some of the redesign rationale and changes that we made and tried to implement to the hi-fidelity prototype. 

# Overview of the system and demo 
To see me go over the application, watch this demo video! <br />

3. Select "Open a project or solution" in Visual Studio
4. Navigate to the "InstaRideApplicationDesign-master" folder found in the extracted zip-file (or unzipped directory) and open the file "WpfApp3.sln"
